This site will be the front-end for published personal assignments for the course `Client-based web programming` at Linnaeus university - and hopefully some interesting blog entries as well! Currently I'm quite busy trying to wrap my mind around `Jekyll`. In the meantime, check out the [course site][course-site]!
