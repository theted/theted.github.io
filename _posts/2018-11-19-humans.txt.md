## Definition
The purpose of the `humans.txt` file is to present the people behind the website. In contrast to [robots.txt]({% post_url 2018-11-19-robots.txt %}), the humans.txt file is meant to be read by humans only - it does not need to follow any specific syntax or rules. The humans.txt file typically contains contact information for the people involved in creating the webite and, optionally, a list of technologies used as well as a thank-you note or any other relevant information.
