## What is Open Graph?
Open Graph is a scheme used for describing what content should be used in excerpts when linking to an URL on social media. It allows to specify title, a short description, an image, as well as the type of content of the URL (for example a movie or an text article), It is developed by Facebook and is from the start optimized for sharing content on social media. Open Graph can be looked at as an addition to the traditional meta-data parameters *title* and *description*; it allows webmasters to fine-tune how the page should appear when it is shared on social media. Open Graph is now adopted by a wide variety of services. Documentation is available at the [Open Graph website][open-graph] website.


### Usage of Open Graph on this site
Open Graph is easily implemented using built-in support in Jekyll's default minima theme. I have also added an default image which is used across all pages.
